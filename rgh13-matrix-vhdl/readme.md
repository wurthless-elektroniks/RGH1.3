Basically Octal450's timing files but with a shorter PLL assert delay.

## Compiling

Instructions by RoanPlayz [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/360hacks/comments/1inkdfk/compiling_svfxsvf_timing_files_guide_triplequad/).

Note that Xilinx ISE Design Suite will crash randomly on newer Windows versions. The typical workaround for this is to replace
`libPortability.dll` with `libPortabilityNOSH.dll`.
